Remember, every small victory is one more step towards success. So get ready to dive into starklings, unlock your potential and enjoy the exciting journey that awaits you!

## Setup and run

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed with the `default` toolchain.  
With rustup `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s`

1. Clone the repo and go in the directory,  
   `git clone https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1.git && cd starklings-cairo1`.
2. Run `cargo run -r --bin starklings`, this might take a while the first time.
3. You should see this intro message, run `cargo run -r --bin starklings watch` when you are ready!

## Start at a specific exercise `NEW`

To start watch at a specific exercise pass the name of the exercise to watch command.
For example, to start at `starknet1`,

```
cargo run -r --bin starklings watch starknet1
```

## Welcome message and instrucitons

```
starklings - An interactive tutorial to get started with Cairo and Starknet

Thanks for installing starklings!

Is this your first time? Don't worry, starklings is made for beginners! We are
going to teach you a bunch of stuff about StarkNet and Cairo.

Here's how starklings works,

1. **Start the program:**
    To get started, you need to open a command window on your computer and type a special command. This command is `cargo run -r --bin starklings watch`. This will launch the program and begin teaching you about a topic called StarkNet and Cairo.

2. **Resolve the problems:**
    When the program starts, you will see instructions and problems that you need to solve. You may see some error messages at first, but don't worry! It's part of the challenge. You will have to open files and look for clues to solve these problems.

3. **Get help if you get stuck:**
    If you encounter a difficult problem, the program has a function to give you hints. You can type `hint` or use `cargo run -r --bin starklings hint exercise_name` to get a hint on how to solve it.

4. **Mark resolved issues:**
    When you have found the solution to a problem, you need to make a small change to a file. Look for a comment that says `// I AM NOT DONE` and remove it. This will tell the program that you have finished that problem and you can move on to the next one.

5. **Ask for help if you need it:**
    If at any time you feel confused or need more help, don't hesitate to ask for help! You can go to the program's website (https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1) and open a message to explain what you are stuck on.

Remember, it's normal to feel a little confused at first. The most important thing is not to give up and keep trying. Have fun learning with starklings!
## VSCode extension & language server

In order to have syntax highlighting and language server features, you will need to install the Cairo Language Server. The instructions available in the [Cairo repository](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/main/vscode-cairo)

## Inspiration

-   [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), starklings is forked from Rustlings. Thanks to all the original [authors and contributors](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

## Testing

#### For Cairo related tests

```
cargo test cairo
```

#### For all tests

```
cargo test
```

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the project. You can fork the repo, create a branch with a descriptive name (maybe the issue number and a word or two to describe it) and submit a pull request.

### Adding new exercises

1. New exercises can be added in `./exercises` directory.
2. Insert information about the exercise in `./info.toml` file. For example
    ```toml
    [[exercises]]
    name = "new_exercise"
    path = "exercises/new_module/new_exercise.cairo"
    mode = "compile" # or "test"
    hint = """"""
    ```
3. Check that the [tests](#testing) pass.
4. Send your PR!

### Updating Rust logic/Cairo version

1. [Test](#testing) your changes.
2. Make sure you have solutions to all the exercises in `./solutions` directory.
3. Run `cargo run -r --bin starklings compile_solutions` to confirm all exercise solutions still compile.
4. Make your pull request.
